Create your own generic linked list.
You list must provide methods to:
Insert (at any position),
Delete (at any position),
Print (any element),
Print (whole list),
Count (elements),
Add (add to the end). 
Name of the list could be whatever you want Example:

let list = new SuperList();
list.Add(1);
list.Add(2);
list.Insert(0,1);
list.Print();

//outputs: 1 -> 1 -> 2

Please follow a coding style and best practices.
